On a Route v0.1.1

Desc.
This version adds Save system, meaning you can continue your game after you close it, + auto-save is implemented too.
Just be sure to put the versions from now on into the same folder, I want future versions to be able to use old saves,
backwards compatibility not guaranteed

Changes:
+ New Saving System
+ Added Auto Save
