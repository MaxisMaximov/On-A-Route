On a Route v0.1.1

Note: For some reason this version converts into a huge directory unlike other versions, if you have Python installed
you can download the raw file and launch it

Desc.
This version adds Save system, meaning you can continue your game after you close it, + auto-save is implemented too.
Just be sure to put the versions from now on into the same folder, I want future versions to be able to use old saves,
backwards compatibility not guaranteed

Changes:
+ New Saving System
+ Added Auto Save
