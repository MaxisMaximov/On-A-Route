On a Route v0.1.2

Desc.
This version adds new enemies at last and finally uses the Defense mechanic.
The defense value is in %, so 10 Defense is 10% againsts incoming damage, 25 is 25% etc., although it's a subject to 
change if it'll cause too much disbalance
Also some Bug Fixes, like the Only Zombie Fight issue fix and No New Game if Game Over bug.
I can't believe I skipped over those two so easily

Changes:
+ New Enemies
+ New Defense mechanic
+ Bug Fixes
