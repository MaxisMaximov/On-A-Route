# What is this (Basics)
This is a tiny project of mine

# What is this (Intermediate?)
On A Route is a text-based adventure game situated in the Grand Wasteland, Europe, 2281. The world governments' experiments with Biological Weaponry have gone wrong and Virus 0xDB5, codenamed "Exilator" has broken out. Over the years one by one every human was either being infected, mauled to death by the horrors, dying in great internal suffering or taken to an unknown place. The horrors the virus has created were unimaginable, from brain-dead former humans to terrifying creatures twice the size of a person. Those that had survived made villages, towns and cities all across the place they once called home. Half of those places either got infected, destroyed, or massacred by the same survivors, who had gone insane. Those who chose the path of perpetual wandering have survived more than one can imagine, and as such are being treated with honor. You are a lone survivor from survivor village Haj√∂r who is constantly travelling in hopes of finding salvation one day. Find materials, craft your weaponry and armor, fight whatever stands in your way, trade, lead a journal. This is where your story begins.
